# Tileman Mode Custom Plugin 
Tileman Mode is a series on youtube, check out the playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLNTajexsGYaw5pcyLOMyrW6w8_IMDG90">here</a>.

The game mode is defined by the player being limited to standing on certain tiles. The amount of tiles you are allowed to stand on depends on your total experience. Each 1000 exp represents one tile you can 'spend'. 

This plugin sets out to make the marking of tiles and the counting of both your used and remaining tiles automated.

## Features
Automatically fill in tiles as you walk/run with 'Auto-mark'.

Draw tiles on the minimap.

Ability for the tiles/overlay change colour to notify you when you've gone over your set tile limit or when you use up all your tiles.

Choose from a selection of gamemodes, each with different rules and difficulties.

Option to add additional tiles to your total usable tiles.

Option to include your total level in the total usable tiles, along side your exp tiles. 

Ability to import Ground Marker tiles, if you started playing using the Ground Marker plugin.

Natively supports import/export of tiles for Group Tileman gameplay (no additional plugins required).

## Known Issues
Moving between map chunks will sometimes cause tiles to be missed.
